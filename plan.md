___________

### The prompt 

I want to create a full pipeline for llm pretraining on AWS. 
the LLM architecture must be GPT-2 128M, but make the code modular so that I can plug and pre-train any LLM. the code for the LLM must be in PyTorch lightning. 

choose a good llm pretraining dataset - also, make this piece modular so that I can plug any dataset. the data shall be stored in aws s3. write code for data preparation and storage. 

write code for distributed training set up in aws. implement multi-node distributed training using PyTorch lightning, and apply multiple parallelism modes. 

before you write the code, please create a detailed plan and confirm with me 

### Cursor's GPT-5 plan 

Let me draft a detailed, modular plan for your end-to-end AWS LLM pretraining pipeline (GPT‑2 128M baseline), then you can
  confirm choices before I implement.

  Goals

  • Modular LLM pretraining pipeline in PyTorch Lightning.
  • Baseline model: GPT-2 ~128M parameters (GPT‑2 small, ~124M).
  • Dataset-agnostic data layer with default high-quality open pretraining corpus.
  • Data preparation and storage in S3 with scalable sharding.
  • Multi-node distributed training on AWS with multiple parallelism modes.
  • Clean, extensible repo structure and configuration.


  High-level architecture

  • Packages
    • llm_core: Model interfaces, GPT‑2 LightningModule, tokenizer handling, registry for plug‑in models.
    • data_core: Dataset builders, preprocessing/tokenization, shard writers, DataModules for train/val streaming from S3.
    • training: Trainer factory, strategy configs (DDP, FSDP, DeepSpeed), callbacks/logging/checkpointing.
    • aws: Launchers for SageMaker and EC2/torchrun, environment bootstrap, IAM/S3 utilities.
    • configs: Hydra YAMLs for model, data, training, aws, experiment overrides.
    • scripts: CLI to prepare data, upload to S3, launch/monitor jobs, resume training.
  • Principles
    • Registry-based modularity for models and datasets.
    • Config-first via Hydra: no hard-coded params.
    • Stateless workers; all artifacts in S3 (tokenizer, processed shards, checkpoints, logs).


  Model layer (PyTorch Lightning)

  • LLM interface
    • LanguageModelModule base LightningModule with: configure_optimizers, training_step, validation_step, loss-only training for
      causal LM.
    • Registry ModelFactory to select models via model.name=gpt2 or custom.
  • GPT‑2 128M baseline
    • Config: n_layer=12, n_head=12, n_embd=768, context length 1024.
    • Implementation: Hugging Face transformers model wrapped in Lightning. Supports gradient checkpointing, FlashAttention 2 (if
      available), fused optimizers (AdamW or Lion), mixed precision (bf16/fp16).
  • Tokenizer
    • Default: GPT‑2 BPE (gpt2) for immediate start.
    • Optional: train a new tokenizer via tokenizers on a sample; artifact saved to S3 and referenced by all workers.


  Dataset strategy (modular)

  • Default dataset recommendation
    • Dolma (AI2) or SlimPajama (RedPajama-derived, deduped). Both are high-quality, permissively licensed, widely used for
      pretraining.
    • I recommend Dolma as default due to quality, active maintenance, and permissive licensing. We’ll also provide a small
      “OpenWebText” path for smoke tests.
  • Dataset builder interface
    • DatasetBuilder.prepare(raw_source -> S3 shards): Ingest HF or external sources, clean/filter, tokenize, pack sequences,
      shard, and write to S3.
    • DatasetBuilder.datamodule(...): Returns a LightningDataModule that streams from S3 shards with distributed-aware sampling.
  • Preprocessing
    • Normalization: Unicode NFC, whitespace folding, simple heuristic filters (length, language if desired).
    • Tokenization: GPT‑2 BPE or custom.
    • Packing: fixed-length sequences (e.g., 1024) with document boundary handling; optionally sample-efficient packing.
    • Sharding format (choose one, both supported):
      • WebDataset tar shards (.tar) with tokens.npy entries and minimal metadata; shard size ~512MB–1GB.
      • Binary .mmap style (.bin + .idx) for maximal throughput (Nanogpt-style). Download-then-mmap to local NVMe cache per node.
  • Storage in S3
    • Layout: s3://<bucket>/<project>/data/<dataset>/<tokenizer_id>/seq<ctx_len>/shard-{000000..N}.tar
    • Tokenizer artifact: s3://.../tokenizer/<tokenizer_id>/...
    • Manifest files for train/val splits.


  DataModule design (S3 streaming/caching)

  • S3 access via fsspec/s3fs with role/IAM.
  • Multi-node, multi-GPU aware sampling; shard assignment based on global_rank.
  • Async prefetch and local disk cache (per-node NVMe) for high throughput.
  • Optional on-the-fly mixture sampling across multiple datasets via weighted blending.


  Distributed training modes (Lightning)

  • All modes configurable via Hydra flags; identical code paths.
  • DDP (baseline)
    • DDPStrategy with NCCL backend, gradient accumulation, bf16, activation checkpointing.
  • FSDP (param sharding)
    • FSDPStrategy with transformer auto-wrap policy, full shard, CPU offload optional, activation checkpointing and
      use_orig_params=True.
  • DeepSpeed (ZeRO)
    • DeepSpeedStrategy with ZeRO-2/3 configs, CPU/NVMe offload options.
  • Note: Pipeline/tensor parallelism are not first-class in Lightning; if required later, we can add DeepSpeed pipeline parallel
    or DTensor in a phase 2. For now you’ll have DDP+FSDP+ZeRO.


  AWS deployment options

  • Recommended: start with SageMaker Training for simplest multi-node orchestration; also provide EC2/torchrun path.
  • Option A: SageMaker Training (recommended)
    • Instances: p4d.24xlarge (8x A100 40GB) or p5.48xlarge (8x H100 80GB). Multi-node with EFA.
    • Estimator launches Lightning script; S3 channels for data/configs; checkpoints/logs to S3.
    • Spot training optional; retries and auto-resume from S3 checkpoint.
    • Metrics to CloudWatch; optional W&B logger.
  • Option B: EC2 + torchrun
    • Provision multi-node GPU cluster (Terraform/ParallelCluster), enable EFA, NCCL tuning.
    • Bootstrap with AMI user data to install drivers, CUDA, PyTorch, efs or local NVMe cache.
    • Launch via torchrun --nproc_per_node ... --nnodes ... --rdzv_backend c10d ....
  • Option C: EKS + Kubeflow (defer)
    • PytorchJob CRD; good for long-term MLOps, but heavier to set up. Optional phase 2.


  Checkpointing, evaluation, logging

  • Checkpoints to S3 every N steps and on best val perplexity; periodic shard-safe saving in distributed mode.
  • Validation: perplexity on held-out subset; optional downstream eval hooks later.
  • Logging: TensorBoard by default; W&B optional; metrics mirrored to CloudWatch on SageMaker.


  Configuration and reproducibility

  • Hydra-based configs:
    • configs/model/gpt2_128m.yaml
    • configs/data/dolma_seq1024.yaml, openwebtext_tiny.yaml
    • configs/train/{ddp,fsdp,deepspeed}_a100.yaml
    • configs/aws/{sagemaker,ec2}.yaml
    • configs/exp/default.yaml for sweepable hyperparams
  • Single CLI entry points:
    • prepare_data.py (ingest, tokenize, shard, upload to S3)
    • train.py (Lightning Trainer with strategy switch)
    • launch_sagemaker.py / launch_ec2_torchrun.sh


  Performance considerations

  • Enable bf16, fused AdamW, gradient checkpointing, FlashAttention 2 (if GPU supports).
  • Set sequence packing to maximize token throughput.
  • Use EFA, NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME, NCCL_IB_HCA, and appropriate env tuning on EC2.
  • Use local NVMe for shard cache; avoid repeated S3 reads.


  Security/IAM

  • Least-privilege roles for S3 read/write to specific prefixes.
  • KMS encryption at rest on S3; SSE-S3 as default.
  • Optional private subnets + VPC endpoints for S3.


  Deliverables

  • Modular codebase under src/ with registries for models/datasets.
  • Data preparation pipeline producing S3 shards + tokenizer artifacts.
  • Lightning training with DDP, FSDP, DeepSpeed strategies selectable via config.
  • AWS launchers for SageMaker and EC2 with example configs.
  • Minimal README covering setup/usage; example commands for smoke test and multi-node run.


  Open choices to confirm

  • Orchestration: SageMaker (recommended) vs EC2/torchrun as primary target?
  • Default dataset: Dolma vs SlimPajama as the main pretraining corpus? (I recommend Dolma.)
  • Tokenizer: Use GPT‑2 BPE initially, with optional tokenizer training later — OK?
  • Parallelism set: Ship DDP, FSDP, DeepSpeed ZeRO-2/3 in v1; pipeline/tensor parallel later — OK?
  • Target hardware: How many nodes/GPUs? (e.g., 2–8 nodes of p4d/p5)
  • Observability: Use W&B in addition to TB/CloudWatch?

  Once you confirm these, I’ll implement the code, configs, and launch scripts accordingly.
  I’m ready to proceed as soon as you pick the orchestration, dataset, tokenizer choice, and rough cluster size.
  • I drafted a detailed plan covering model, data, distributed strategies, and AWS deployment, and listed decisions needed from
    you to proceed.

### Prompt 2
yes, this sounds good. for the aws deployment, use option b: ec2 + torchrun. can we go with the pile dataset? go with         │
 │ your choice of the tokenizer, in the next iteration, we can add optional tokenizer training. for parallelism, try             │
 │ implementing 2d parallelism - Tensor Parallelsim and FSDP. provide flexibility to switch to DDP/FSDP/ZeRO-2 or ZeRO 3.        │
 │ for the hardware, what would you recommend. my training budget is $150. calculate how long it'd take for training the         │
 │ model and provide an estimate and confirm with me. Observability - no. just TB/Cloudwatch is sufficient for now.

  Let me update the plan per your choices and give you a concrete time/cost estimate within a $150 budget. Once you confirm, I’ll
   implement everything.

  Scope updates you requested

  • Orchestration: EC2 + torchrun (multi-node supported).
  • Dataset: The Pile (HF source), modular data layer for future datasets.
  • Tokenizer: Start with GPT‑2 BPE; optional tokenizer training later.
  • Parallelism: Add 2D parallelism (Tensor Parallelism + FSDP), plus flexible DDP/FSDP/DeepSpeed ZeRO‑2/3.
  • Observability: TensorBoard + CloudWatch only.


  Architecture (concise)

  • Model
    • LightningModule base for causal LM; optimizer/scheduler pluggable.
    • GPT‑2 124M config (12L, 12H, 768d, ctx 1024).
    • Hooks for gradient checkpointing, bf16/fp16, FlashAttention 2 if available.
    • 2D parallel support:
      • TP: intra-node tensor parallel groups (tp_size), via parallel linear kernels (row/col sharding) with
        all_gather/reduce_scatter.
      • FSDP: shard across data-parallel groups (dp_size), auto-wrap transformer blocks; CPU offload optional.
      • Process-group layout: TP confined within a node; FSDP spans DP groups across nodes. Fallbacks: tp_size=1 => pure FSDP;
        strategy switches for DDP/DeepSpeed ZeRO‑2/3.
  • Data
    • Dataset builder for The Pile: stream from HF, normalize text, filter, tokenize (GPT‑2 BPE), pack to fixed seq_len (e.g.,
      1024), write shards.
    • Shard formats:
      • Default: memory‑mappable .bin/.idx (download to NVMe cache then mmap).
      • Optional: WebDataset .tar shards for streaming.
    • S3 layout: s3://<bucket>/<proj>/data/the_pile/<tok_id>/seq<1024>/train/shard-xxxxx.bin (+ manifests), tokenizer saved
      under tokenizer/<tok_id>/.
  • Training
    • Lightning Trainer factory with strategies:
      • ddp, fsdp (full shard, auto-wrap), deepspeed_zero2, deepspeed_zero3, and 2d_tp_fsdp.
    • Checkpointing to S3, resume support, periodic val perplexity.
  • AWS (EC2 + torchrun)
    • Bootstrap script: drivers/CUDA, PyTorch, Lightning, s3fs, FlashAttention (if GPU supports), NCCL tuning.
    • Torchrun launcher: sets --nnodes, --nproc_per_node, --rdzv params; exports NCCL env and TP/FSDP group env.
    • Multi-node: TP confined in-node; FSDP across DP groups to minimize inter-node collectives. EFA not strictly required for
      this size; we’ll prefer 10/25Gbps networking unless you choose p4/p5.


  Hardware recommendation for $150

  • Goal: Train compute‑optimal for GPT‑2‑124M (~2.5B tokens; Chinchilla rule-of-thumb).
  • Best value (spot pricing assumed; on-demand also shown):
    • 1× g5.12xlarge (4× A10G 24GB)
      • Spot: ~$2–3/hr; On‑demand: ~$6–8/hr (region‑dependent).
      • Estimated wall‑time for 2.5B tokens: 8–12 hours.
      • Cost: Spot ~$16–$36; On‑demand ~$48–$96.
    • Alternatives:
      • 2× g5.12xlarge (8 GPUs): ~5–7 hours; Spot ~$24–$48; On‑demand ~$72–$128.
      • 1× g5.xlarge (1 GPU): ~30–45 hours; Spot ~$10–$18; On‑demand ~$30–$50.
  • Notes:
    • Ranges include 30–50% overhead (I/O, optimizer, comms). A10G fp16/bf16 throughput is enough for this model size.
    • Your $150 budget easily fits any of these (even on-demand), with headroom for retries and S3.


  Training time/cost estimate (method)

  • Compute‑optimal tokens: ~2.5B for 124M params.
  • Training FLOPs ≈ 6 × N × D ≈ 6 × 124e6 × 2.5e9 ≈ 1.86e18 FLOPs.
  • Effective per‑GPU training throughput on A10G assumed ~20–35 TFLOPs.
  • Estimated hours = FLOPs / (effective_TFLOPs × num_GPUs × 3.6e15).
    • 1× A10G: ~30–45 h; 4× A10G: ~8–12 h; 8× A10G: ~5–7 h.


  Key implementation details

  • TP kernels: ColumnParallelLinear and RowParallelLinear layers wrapping nn.Linear for MLP and attention projections;
    collective ops inside TP groups. Modular so other models can register a TP policy.
  • FSDP: Lightning FSDPStrategy with FULL_SHARD, auto-wrap on TransformerBlock, optional CPU offload; groups formed orthogonal
    to TP groups.
  • Configs: Hydra with toggles for parallel.strategy, tp_size, dp_size, fsdp.*, deepspeed.*, etc.
  • Data prep CLI: build The Pile shards locally or on a small CPU instance, upload to S3, create manifests; deterministic
    splits.
  • Caching: per-node NVMe cache for shards; prefetched asynchronously; shard assignment aware of global_rank.


  What I need from you to proceed

  • Confirm the hardware choice and runtime target:
    • Option A: 1× g5.12xlarge (4 GPUs), spot, target 10–12 hours.
    • Option B: 2× g5.12xlarge (8 GPUs), spot, target 6–7 hours.
    • Option C: 1× g5.xlarge (1 GPU), spot, target 35–40 hours.
  • Provide S3 bucket name and AWS region to use.
  • Confirm training target tokens: use ~2.5B tokens (compute‑optimal) for v1? If you prefer a cheaper/shorter first run, we
    can do 1.0B tokens.

  Once you confirm these, I’ll implement the full codebase (model, data prep, S3 IO, TP+FSDP strategy, torchrun launchers, Hydra
  configs) and hand you ready-to-run scripts.
  • I’ve updated the plan (EC2 + torchrun, The Pile, GPT‑2 BPE, 2D TP+FSDP) and provided concrete time/cost estimates under
    $150 with recommended hardware.

-----
⬢ To-do All done
    ☒ Scaffold repo structure, requirements, and base config files
    ☒ Implement Lightning base module and GPT-2 124M module
    ☒ Add tensor-parallel linear layers and process group utils
    ☒ Implement TP+FSDP Lightning strategy and integration
    ☒ Build The Pile data prep pipeline and S3 sharding
    ☒ Implement S3-cached mmap dataset and LightningDataModule
    ☒ Create Hydra configs for model, data, train, aws
    ☒ Create train entrypoint with strategy selection and token-based schedule
    ☒ Add EC2 bootstrap and torchrun launch scripts

  • I scaffolded the repo, implemented the modular model layer (GPT‑2 Lightning baseline and a TP-capable custom GPT‑2),
    S3-based data prep/ingest for The Pile, a memory-mapped S3 DataModule, multi-strategy training (DDP/FSDP/DeepSpeed
    ZeRO‑2/3), and a 2D TP+FSDP path with EC2 + torchrun launch scripts. Region set to us-east-2 as requested. Next, I’ll
    wait for your go/no-go on the time/cost estimate and I can proceed with data prep and training steps.


  Confirmation: AWS region and hardware

  • Region: us-east-2 (Ohio)
  • Hardware: Option B — 2× g5.12xlarge (8× A10G total)


  Time and cost estimate (2.5B tokens, GPT‑2 124M, 8× A10G)

  • Estimated wall-clock: 6–8 hours (bf16, grad checkpointing, simple TP=2 + FSDP, NVMe cache, network TCP).
  • Spot cost in us-east-2: roughly $4–6/hour total for both nodes → $24–$48 for 6–8 hours.
  • On-demand cost in us-east-2: roughly $12–16/hour total for both nodes → $72–$128 for 6–8 hours.
  • Budget fit: within $150 with headroom even on on-demand. Spot gives extra margin.

  Notes:
  • Estimate includes overhead (I/O, optimizer, communication). Actuals vary with spot preemptions and available throughput.
    The Pile preprocessing to S3 is separate time/cost; consider running it on a smaller/cheaper instance first and stopping
    at 2.5B tokens worth of shards.


  What’s implemented

  • Model
    • GPT2LightningModule (Hugging Face) for standard DDP/FSDP/ZeRO.
    • GPT2CustomLightningModule with tensor-parallel blocks (Column/Row sharded linears) for 2D TP+FSDP.
  • Parallelism/strategies
    • Switchable: ddp, fsdp, deepspeed_zero2, deepspeed_zero3, tp_fsdp.
    • tp_fsdp forms TP groups per node; FSDP shards across all ranks.
  • Data prep and storage (The Pile → S3)
    • Streaming ingest from HF, GPT‑2 BPE tokenization, fixed-length packing, shards to S3 as .bin.
    • Manifests saved in S3; tokenizer artifact path encoded in manifest.
  • Data module
    • S3 -> local NVMe cache -> memmap; distributed-safe DataLoaders.
  • EC2 + torchrun
    • Bootstrap script, launch script, and multi-node instructions.
  • Configs
    • Hydra-style YAMLs for model, data, train, and AWS.


  How to run (concise)

  • Prepare ~2.5B tokens (will stop when target reached):


     1 │python -m src.scripts.prepare_data --bucket gpt_data --region us-east-2 \
     2 │  --seq_len 1024 --num_tokens 2500000000 --shard_tokens 20000000 --tokenizer gpt2

  • Train on 2 nodes × 4 GPUs (TP=2 + FSDP):


  bash scripts/launch_torchrun.sh 2 4 <MASTER_PRIVATE_IP>:29400

  Would you like me to proceed with this plan and start the data preparation and training steps using us-east-2 with 2×
  g5.12xlarge? If yes, I’ll finalize any small config tweaks and provide exact commands for your environment.
  • I set the region to us-east-2 and implemented the complete pipeline with 2D TP+FSDP, The Pile preprocessing to S3, and
    EC2 + torchrun scripts. Estimated 6–8 hours and $24–$48 (spot) or $72–$128 (on‑demand), within your $150 budget.


-----

i have a question before you do anything. are you storing the graphs for the training loss and everything so that I can       │
 │ revisit this later after the training? also, would you destroy the on-demand instance to cut unnecessary cost?                │
 └───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘


  I’ll answer your questions first; no changes applied in this step.
  • Yes, training curves will be preserved:
    • TensorBoard event files are written locally during training and will be synced to S3 so you can revisit later:
      s3://gpt_data/logs/gpt2_124m_pile/. Checkpoints are under s3://gpt_data/checkpoints/gpt2_124m_pile/. Stdout/stderr go to
      CloudWatch if the instance’s logging agent is enabled.
    • If you prefer, I can wire an automatic sync on every validation epoch and at train end so nothing is lost before
      termination.
  • Instance cost control:
    • We’ll use spot as planned. If an on-demand fallback is used, I can auto-terminate instances after training completes
      (post-sync) to avoid idle costs. I’ll add a toggle (AUTO_TERMINATE=true) so it only happens when you want it.

  If you’re OK with this, I’ll enable the auto S3 sync and the optional auto-terminate toggle in the launcher so logs/ckpts are
  uploaded first, then instances shut down if requested.
  Quick commands you can run manually anytime:

     1 │# Sync logs and checkpoints to S3
     2 │export RUN_NAME=gpt2_124m_pile
     3 │aws s3 sync tb_logs s3://gpt_data/logs/$RUN_NAME/
     4 │aws s3 sync .ckpts s3://gpt_data/checkpoints/$RUN_NAME/
     5 │
     6 │# Terminate current instance (after sync)
     7 │INSTANCE_ID=$(curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/instance-id)
     8 │aws ec2 terminate-instances --instance-ids "$INSTANCE_ID" --region us-east-2

  • We’ll persist TB logs to S3 (s3://gpt_data/logs/gpt2_124m_pile/) and checkpoints to
    s3://gpt_data/checkpoints/gpt2_124m_pile/. I can add automatic sync and optional auto-terminate-after-training; confirm if
    you want this enabled by default.

-----------

  ⬢ To-do All done
    ☒ Add S3 sync for TB logs and checkpoints with periodic and final uploads
    ☒ Add optional auto-terminate after training with safe final sync

  • I added automatic persistence of training curves and checkpoints to S3 and an optional auto-terminate script so you won’t
     pay for idle instances after completion.


  Answers to your questions

  • Training graphs retention:
    • TensorBoard events and checkpoints are auto-synced during validation epochs and at the end of training to:
      • Logs: s3://gpt_data/logs/gpt2_124m_pile/
      • Checkpoints: s3://gpt_data/checkpoints/gpt2_124m_pile/
    • You can revisit them anytime; no W&B dependency.
  • Cost control (instance shutdown):
    • I added scripts/auto_terminate_after_training.sh. When AUTO_TERMINATE=true, it syncs logs/ckpts, then terminates the
      instance.
    • You can enable it in your launch workflow or run it manually.


  How to enable auto-terminate

  • Set env vars on each node before/after training:


     1 │export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-2
     2 │export S3_BUCKET=gpt_data
     3 │export RUN_NAME=gpt2_124m_pile
     4 │export AUTO_TERMINATE=true
     5 │bash scripts/auto_terminate_after_training.sh

  • The training process itself also performs periodic and final S3 syncs, so data is safe even if a spot instance is
    reclaimed.
  • I configured S3 syncing for TB logs and checkpoints and added an optional auto-terminate pathway so you can avoid
    unnecessary cost.

 I’ll proceed by giving you the exact commands to run for data prep and for launching the multi-node training on EC2 with
  TP+FSDP. I won’t start any long-running jobs from here.
  • First, prepare 2.5B tokens of The Pile to S3 (us-east-2):


     1 │python -m src.scripts.prepare_data --bucket gpt_data --region us-east-2 \
     2 │  --seq_len 1024 --num_tokens 2500000000 --shard_tokens 20000000 --tokenizer gpt2

  • Provision two g5.12xlarge spot instances in us-east-2 (replace placeholders):


     1 │# Create 2 spot instances using your VPC/subnet/SG/role
     2 │aws ec2 run-instances --region us-east-2 \
     3 │  --image-id <DLAMI_UBUNTU_22_04_AMI_ID> \
     4 │  --count 2 --instance-type g5.12xlarge \
     5 │  --instance-market-options "MarketType=spot" \
     6 │  --iam-instance-profile Name=<EC2_ROLE_WITH_S3_ACCESS> \
     7 │  --subnet-id <SUBNET_ID> --security-group-ids <SG_ID_ALLOWING_TCP_29400_BETWEEN_NODES> \
     8 │  --tag-specifications 'ResourceType=instance,Tags=[{Key=Name,Value=gpt2-train}]'

  • Copy repo and bootstrap on both nodes:


     1 │# On your laptop
     2 │scp -r . ubuntu@<NODE0_EIP_OR_PVT_IP>:/opt/project
     3 │scp -r . ubuntu@<NODE1_EIP_OR_PVT_IP>:/opt/project
     4 │
     5 │# On each node
     6 │cd /opt/project
     7 │bash scripts/ec2_bootstrap.sh

  • Launch training on both nodes (TP=2 + FSDP). Use the master node’s private IP as rendezvous:


     1 │# On BOTH nodes (run nearly simultaneously)
     2 │export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-2
     3 │export S3_BUCKET=gpt_data
     4 │export RUN_NAME=gpt2_124m_pile
     5 │export AUTO_TERMINATE=true  # set false if you don't want auto-shutdown
     6 │
     7 │# Master node (replace <MASTER_PRIVATE_IP>):
     8 │bash scripts/launch_torchrun.sh 2 4 <MASTER_PRIVATE_IP>:29400 gpt2_run \
     9 │  && bash scripts/auto_terminate_after_training.sh
    10 │
    11 │# Worker node (same command, same rendezvous)
    12 │bash scripts/launch_torchrun.sh 2 4 <MASTER_PRIVATE_IP>:29400 gpt2_run \
    13 │  && bash scripts/auto_terminate_after_training.sh

  • Where to find outputs:
    • TB logs: s3://gpt_data/logs/gpt2_124m_pile/
    • Checkpoints: s3://gpt_data/checkpoints/gpt2_124m_pile/
  • Expected run: ~6–8 hours on 2× g5.12xlarge (8× A10G), within your $150 budget (spot).
  • I staged auto S3 sync during training and at the end. If AUTO_TERMINATE=true, each node syncs and then terminates.
  • I’m ready to help if you want me to tailor the run-instances command to your VPC details or add a quick smoke test (e.g.,
     20M tokens) before the full 2.5B run.

#### Perplexity: The plan:

# Proposed Plan for a Modular LLM Pretraining Pipeline on AWS

Below is a detailed, step-by-step plan for building a fully modular, end-to-end GPT-2 (128 M) pretraining pipeline in PyTorch Lightning on AWS.  Once you confirm this plan, we will proceed to implement each component in code.

***

## 1. Objectives & High-Level Architecture

**Primary Goal**  
-  Pretrain a GPT-2-128 M model (with ability to swap in any Transformer-style model) on a large text corpus stored in Amazon S3, using multi-node distributed training with multiple parallelism modes in PyTorch Lightning.

**Core Components**  
1. **Data Preparation & Storage**  
   – Text dataset ingestion (e.g. The Pile, C4, or custom)  
   – Tokenization & sharding  
   – Upload preprocessed shards to S3  

2. **Modular Model Definition**  
   – GPT-2-128 M LightningModule  
   – Abstract base class / config-driven factory to plug in any other Transformer architecture  

3. **Distributed Training Setup**  
   – Lightning Trainer configured for multi-node DDP, FSDP, tensor parallelism, and (optionally) pipeline parallelism via plugin  
   – AWS cluster provisioning (EC2 Auto Scaling Group or AWS ParallelCluster)  
   – Entrypoint script with torch.distributed.run or SLURM integration  

4. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**  
   – CloudFormation (or Terraform) template to spin up:  
     -  EC2 instances with GPU (e.g. p3dn.24xlarge)  
     -  IAM roles granting S3 read/write  
     -  VPC, security groups, auto-scaling  

5. **Monitoring & Checkpointing**  
   – Syncing checkpoints and logs to S3  
   – Integration with Weights & Biases or CloudWatch  

***

## 2. Detailed Module Breakdown

### A. Data Pipeline Module  
1. **Dataset Abstraction**  
   - Abstract `DatasetConfig` class with methods:  
     -  `download_raw()`  
     -  `preprocess_to_shards()`  
   - Plug‐and‐play implementations for:  
     -  The Pile (via `datasets` library)  
     -  C4 (TensorFlow Datasets)  
     -  Custom text corpus  

2. **Preprocessing Script** (`prepare_data.py`)  
   - Tokenizer initialization (configurable: GPT2Tokenizer, custom tokenizers)  
   - Streaming text → token sequences → fixed-length examples  
   - Write shards as TFRecords or Arrow files  

3. **S3 Utilities** (`s3_utils.py`)  
   - Upload/download shards  
   - Manage prefixes, versioning, and IAM permissions  

### B. Model Module  
1. **Model Factory** (`models/__init__.py`)  
   - `get_model(config)` returns a subclass of `LightningModule`  
2. **GPT-2-128 M Implementation** (`models/gpt2_128m.py`)  
   - Configurable hyperparameters: number of layers, heads, embedding size  
3. **Base LightningModule** (`models/base_llm.py`)  
   - Implements forward, training/validation steps, loss computation, and optimization  

### C. Training Module  
1. **DataModule** (`train/data_module.py`)  
   - Loads preprocessed shards from S3  
   - Configurable `batch_size`, `num_workers`, `shuffle_buffer`  
2. **Training Script** (`train/train.py`)  
   - Argument parsing (Hydra or argparse) for:  
     -  Model name  
     -  Dataset name and S3 URIs  
     -  Distributed strategy (`ddp`, `fsdp`, `model_parallel`, custom plugin)  
     -  Node count, devices per node, master address/port  
   - Initializes Trainer with desired strategy  

### D. Infrastructure Module  
1. **CloudFormation Template** (`infra/cluster.yaml`)  
   - EC2 Launch Configuration with GPU AMI  
   - Auto Scaling Group for desired `num_nodes`  
   - IAM Role with S3 read/write  
   - Security Group opening required ports for NCCL communication  
2. **Cluster Provisioner Script** (`infra/provision.sh`)  
   - Deploy / tear down stack  
   - Fetch master node’s IP for torchrun  

### E. Monitoring & Checkpointing  
- Lightning’s `ModelCheckpoint` to save to local disk  
- Post-step hook to sync to S3  
- Logging callback for Weights & Biases (or CloudWatch)

## 3. Parallelism Strategy Matrix

| Mode                        | Lightning Strategy                  | Configuration Key                          |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Data Parallel (DDP)         | `"ddp"`                             | `strategy="ddp"`                           |
| Fully Sharded DP (FSDP)     | `"fsdp"`                            | `strategy="fsdp"`                          |
| Tensor Parallel             | `ModelParallelStrategy`             | `strategy=ModelParallelStrategy()`         |
| Hybrid TP + FSDP (2D)       | `ModelParallelStrategy` w/ mesh     | `strategy=ModelParallelStrategy(...)`      |
| Pipeline (via plugin RPC)   | `RPCSequentialPlugin` (custom wrap) | `strategy=RPCSequentialPlugin()`*          |

_\* Pipeline support remains experimental; will require manual plugin registration._  

***

## 4. Execution Workflow

1. **Provision AWS Cluster**  
2. **Prepare & Upload Data** → run `prepare_data.py` → shards in S3  
3. **Launch Training Job**  
   - On master: run `torch.distributed.run` or submit SLURM job  
   - Auto-scale with cluster auto-scaling  
4. **Monitor & Sync Checkpoints** to S3  
5. **Post-Training Evaluation & Model Export**

Please review and confirm whether this plan meets your requirements or if any adjustments are needed (e.g., preferred dataset, specific AWS service like SageMaker, or additional parallelism modes). Once confirmed, I will provide the full code implementation for each component.
